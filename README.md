# DataSciencePortfolio

My first Data Science Portfolio Project

When trying to decide which data set would have the honor of being the backbone of my first data science project, I took a lot of things into concideration. 
There were three criteria I followed for choosing my first dataset to disect. I needed a dataset with many more observations than features (tall not wide dataset),
have multiple different feature types (categorical, numeric, ordinal, location), and have some sort of real world application. Luckily, the Ipeds Data Center provided just what I needed, a rich data set of over 2000 4-year institution. In my initial exploration of the data one plot really stood out: 
![Mean Graduation Rates by Race]("./GraduationRates/Images/MeanGraduationRates.png") 

Given that these are completions within 150% of the time, the numbers are alarmingly low. Additionally, two of the most marginalized communities in the United States, African Americans and Native Americans, have the lowest graduation rates by quite a margin. These statistics gave me the motivation to take this project and try to explain with data why these disparities exist and what contributes to graduation rates as a whole.

My target variable for this problem would be graduation rates, and the problem statement is as follows:

University X has very low graduation rates and even lower amongst students of color. They are facing immmence pressure from the community and board members and 
the leadership of the school needs to respond with a data backed explanation for their poor performance along with a data driven plan for improving their future 
graduation rates. The criteria for a successful project I defined as a prediction within 5% Mean Absolute Error. This felt like a reasonable metric for predicting 
graduation rates. With this goal in mind, I attempted to solve this problem with the data science process while giving data driven explanation for why African American students are less likely to graduate. I found that a University's performance in regards to graduation rates can be largely explained 5 features: sector of institution, residential level, price, revenue, SAT scores, and the interactions amongst them.

## Price
