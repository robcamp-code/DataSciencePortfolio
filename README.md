# DataSciencePortfolio
Data Science Portfolio project to show to employers
When trying to decide which data set would have the honor of being the backbone of my first data science project, I took a lot of things into concideration. 
Their were three criteria I followed for choosing my first dataset to disect. I needed a dataset with many more observations than features (tall not wide dataset),
have multiple different feature types (categorical, numeric, ordinal, location), and have some sort of real world application. Luckily, the Ipeds Data Center provided
just what I needed, a rich data set of over 2000 4-year institution. In my initial exploration of the data one plot really stood out: 
![Mean Graduation Rates by Race]("https://github.com/robcamp-code/DataSciencePorfolio/blob/master/MeanGraduationRates.png?raw=true") 


My target variable would be graduation rates, and the hypothetical problem is as follows:

University X has very low graduation rates and even lower amongst students of color. They are facing immmence pressure from the community and board members and 
the leadership of the school needs to respond with a data backed explanation for their poor performance along with a data driven plan for improving their future 
graduation rates. The criteria for a successful project I defined as a prediction within 5% Mean Absolute Error. This felt like a reasonable metric for projecting 
graduation rates. With this goal in mind, I completed the data science process while uncovering what contributes to a universities performance.
